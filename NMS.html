			<h1 class="page-title">NO MAN'S SKY</h1>
			<p>With its latest update, called Next, No Man’s Sky has rounded off enough of its rough edges and piled in enough content that exploring its weird galaxy is usually rewarding. It’s definitely a treadmill, though, and while there are countless upgrades and ships to acquire, bases to build, and resources to mine, the process of earning them involves hours upon hours of mindless and repetitive work.</p>
			<P>Hopping in a spaceship, flying out of the atmosphere into space, then landing on another planet that looks completely different from the one you just left is as amazing as ever – a feat that still hasn’t been matched. Some worlds are scenic and beautiful, begging you to use the camera mode to capture the views of rolling hills with colorful plants and animals dotting the landscape and a ringed planet hanging over the horizon and peeking out between clouds; others are barren and ugly wastelands; and others are just bizarre. There really is an impressive range of sights.</P>
			<p>The new option to play in third-person perspective is more than welcome because the nicely animated and customizable character models (which can be of any of the available species) really seem to be having a great time bouncing around with their jetpacks. It makes No Man’s Sky much more fun to see someone moving around and interacting with these sparsely populated (by intelligent life, anyway) landscapes.</p>
			<p></p>
			<h2>Characters seem to be having a great time bouncing around with their jetpacks.</h2>
			<p>But even though each world looks different, they’re all still functionally identical. The same environmental shielding bar that decreases when it’s blazingly hot also decreases when it’s absurdly cold or toxic – faster when a visually impressive storm hits – and you always fill it back up by injecting it with with the same cure-all resource. While animal life is hugely varied – sometimes hilariously so, with bouncing blobs, giant rabbit-crabs, flying sharks, and full-on dinosaur-like beasts roaming everywhere – but they have few unique behaviors to distinguish one from the next when you want to do more than look at them.</p>
			<p>Most resources are mined in the same handful of ways, everywhere in the universe. You either hoover them up with one type of laser beam, drill them until they explode with another type, or walk up to them and pick them up. (Or you can shoot rocks in space.) After the first few hours, there aren’t many new tricks up No Man’s Sky’s sleeve when it comes to the moment-to-moment gameplay.</p>
			<p>But there are a few reasons to be careful about diving head-first into multiplayer: for one, you lose the ability to pause your game, but that’s kind of a given. More specific to No Man’s Sky, it becomes dramatically buggier when there are other people involved. While my single-player bugs were limited to problems with mission scripting sometimes not working correctly, in multiplayer I constantly had issues with the indicator markers for other players being in the wrong spots, hearing the audio of a distant player as though they were right next to me, crashes, and, most disturbingly, falling through the floor of a freighter into space where I immediately died from exposure to solar radiation. The kicker, in that case, was that I wasn’t able to retrieve my corpse, which contained my entire inventory. I’d highly recommend creating a manual save (which you can do by building a save point) before you jump into multiplayer.</p>
			<p>Also, be aware that performance isn’t great on any platform. There’s hitching and major pop-in on the PS4 Pro and Xbox One X, especially when landing on a new planet. And on PC, while planetary landings are smoother I couldn’t get a reasonably steady 60 frames per second on any resolution higher than 1080p even with a GTX 1080 and a Core i7-7700. No Man’s Sky doesn’t look good enough to justify that kind of sluggishness.</p>
			<p>Flying from planet to planet in search of the universe’s rarest materials and technologies in No Man’s Sky NEXT scratches an exploratory itch. It still carries a lot of caveats: It’s mechanically repetitive no matter what planet you’re on, the dull combat should be avoided whenever possible, and bugs are plentiful. But buying new ships and building new things is enough motivation to make it entrancing – for a while, at least.</p>
