			<h1 class="page-title" style="color: white;">INJUSTICE 2</h1>
			<p>Like its cast of heroes, Injustice 2 is exceptional. The fight mechanics have been guided in the right direction following 2013’s Injustice: Gods Among Us. The hours of play potential in the new Multiverse mode alone is impressive. The heroes and villains of the DC Universe look better here than they have in any game before, even as they star in a grim and joyless “what-if” storyline. Just like its heroes, though, Injustice 2 overcomes that adversity and soars, with more single-player content than I’ve ever seen in a fighting game at launch and an unrivaled combo system that is a sheer joy once you master it.</p>
			<p>Injustice 2 strikes a fine balance between retaining the strengths of Gods Among Us and making smart changes to improve mechanics. On top of new versions of memorable environmental attacks in which you slam enemies with everything from cars to giant stuffed alligators on the detailed stages, flashy transitions between different areas of the battle locations, and a full arsenal of over-the-top Super Moves including everything from mowing over your enemies with the Batmobile to traveling through time to slam your opponent off the hide of a dinosaur, it makes several big changes. Some of my favorites include the ability to spend meter in order to gain invulnerable movement to escape projectile-happy enemies, allowing you to block some environmental attacks, and a global increase in the speed sharpen the action. Faster walking speed makes matches feel quick and agile, a change from the at times plodding pace of Gods Among Us. New defensive options make fighting ranged specialists like Deadshot or Green Arrow less frustrating than the sometimes oppressive and seemingly endless barrages in we saw in the last game. Plus, the new additions to the cast ably fill a range of niches, such as Dr. Fate and Deadshot and their strong zone control, Black Canary and her quick and technical offense, or Atrocitus and Gorilla Grodd’s more methodical, heavy-hitting styles.</p>
			<p>One of the most impressive mechanical aspects is Injustice 2’s combo options, which are rivaled by few other games. For someone like me who enjoys spending time just beating up the training dummy and seeing what sort of insane juggles I can put together, it’s supremely enjoyable. You can bounce opponents off walls or the floor and launch them high into the air for juggle combos. Spending meter may alter the traits of a special move and open up new uses for combos: for example, Joker’s “BANG!” normally sees him pull out a revolver and fire a shot at his target. However, when used with Meter Burn, the revolver bullet launches his foe into the air, allowing Joker to juggle his victim. Each character has multiple ways to extend combos that are unique to them, and you can add onto that further by factoring in environmental attacks and positioning on the stage.</p>
			<p>I was pleased to see that the more rare equipment changed my characters’ appearances, allowing you to tailor a unique look for your fighter. Changes can be as minor as the style of a breastplate, adding glowing eyes to Batman’s cowl, or giving Scarecrow a hood – or they can be something as major as changing the logo across Superman’s chest. Between the different shaders you can unlock and options for arms, leggings, chest plates and shirts, helmets and headpieces, and new weapons, there are a surprising amount of options for those of us that enjoy dressing for success.</p>
			<p>Injustice 2 also allows you to try your luck for rare equipment by earning loot crates by completing objectives, such as scoring well in Multiverse missions, completing the character-specific tutorials, or completing chapters in Story mode, giving you even more reason to check the Multiverse daily.</p>
			<p>Fair warning: between Multiverse mode, five to 10 hours of Story mode (depending on your skill), and the deep offensive trees unique to each character, the sheer depth of content present might get intimidating for a newcomer once they begin to fully grasp what they’re getting themselves into. Though there are both general and character-specific tutorials, these walkthroughs only scratch the surface of the juggernaut beneath, especially in the case of the latter. Character training gives a brief overview and the bare basics for each face on the roster, but the gap between those introductory fundamentals and the 20-hit, 600-damage combos is wide, and Injustice 2 does little to guide beginners across it. Compared to Street Fighter V’s Mission modes, which teach you useful bread-and-butter combos of increasing difficulty, Injustice 2’s character tutorials impart only the bare minimum to get you started. Those that feel comfortable in executing complex inputs or training muscle memory can jump right in and have a blast, but if you’re new to fighting games you should know that pushing your success beyond the beginning stages will take some practice and time.</p>
			<p>As Injustice 2 launches tonight, I’ll test out the multiplayer servers in a live environment and finalize this review within the next day or two, depending on how things go. But if I had to score it now, I’d give it an 8.5, for great.</p>
